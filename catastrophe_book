cascades 瀑布

volcano, explode, hit rock, died

too hard, take holidays, volcanos, around the world

always work, colleagues welcome

cascades, equipment is good, Washinton peak, leaving, off-road car

tall trees, hotel, newspaper, photo

Wondo, late, Rachel ten-year old, Karen from the newspaper, no good jacket 

blue jacket, Graham, doesn't here, meet us

most important businessman, newspaper, mayor

beautiful, spoke, Karen

Dante peak, second best town, first for the next year

Elliot, brings money, a lot of work for people

warm lake, live, too quiet

animal run away, earthquake, gas explode, died
