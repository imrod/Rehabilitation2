to shrinking down satellite and miniaturizing the technologie the small satellites can deploy more effectively but what you can do is deploy many more of them

the larger commercial satellite are providing damaged airfields and bombed buildings, they can spot objects only 30 centimeters across, even catching a missile being launched

the Ukraine conflict has lounched it into the public domain open source intelligence from small satellite is giving us an independent eye of what's going on

the scientist has now written radar detection software so anyone could search images from the sentinel satellites
