Russia still attacking Ukrain from three angles from the north, the east, and the south.
Russia forces have shelled the large nuclear plant in the whole of europe at a place called Zepergia

at Klemnicki at Rivno and up in Chernoboyl which russian forces control the plant that exploded in 1096

but most of the action most of the fighting has been done in the south down here where Russian forces have burst of Crimea expanding eastwards encircling Mario Paul cutting off electricity, food, water.
And speculation in Ukrain that there's an amphidious assualt about to launched on Odessa, whill they do that then russia will be in control of plenty much the whole black sea caast cutting off Ukraine from the sea
