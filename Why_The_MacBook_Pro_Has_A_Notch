Why The MacBook Pro Has A Notch:
want to reduce the bezel up to 60%
facetime camera, green led indicator, ambient light censor
occupying space previously used by the bezel
making more 16 inch more usable than before
full screen leaving a black bezel like before
make clever not to interfere the on-screen element
cursor moved seemlessly, hiding spot
